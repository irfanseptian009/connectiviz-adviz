# Turbopack Setup for ConnectiViz

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates
- Updated the `dev` script from `next dev` to `next dev --turbo`
- This enables Turbopack for development builds

### 2. Next.js Configuration Updates
- Added Turbopack-specific configuration in `next.config.ts`
- Configured SVG handling for Turbopack using experimental rules
- Modified webpack configuration to only apply during production builds (since Turbopack handles development)

### 3. Key Benefits of Turbopack

#### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Development Server**: Up to 10x faster than webpack in development
- **Incremental Updates**: Only rebuilds changed files
- **Faster HMR**: Hot Module Replacement is significantly faster

#### Compatibility
- **Built-in Support**: Next.js 13+ has native Turbopack support
- **Webpack Fallback**: Production builds still use webpack for stability
- **Same API**: No changes needed in your React components

### 4. How to Use

#### Development
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will now use Turbopack for development builds.

#### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Production builds continue to use webpack for maximum compatibility.

### 5. Turbopack Features Enabled

- **SVG as React Components**: Configured to handle SVG imports properly
- **Package Optimization**: Optimized imports for `lucide-react` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- **Image Optimization**: Works seamlessly with Next.js Image component
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with faster type checking

### 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Fallback to Webpack**: Remove `--turbo` flag from dev script temporarily
2. **Clear Cache**: Run `npm run clean` to clear build cache
3. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Turbopack

### 7. Monitoring Performance

You can monitor the performance improvements by:
- Checking startup time (should be significantly faster)
- Observing HMR speed when making changes
- Monitoring build output for Turbopack indicators

## Note

Turbopack is currently stable for development use. For production builds, Next.js continues to use webpack to ensure maximum compatibility and stability.
